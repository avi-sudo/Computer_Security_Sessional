This repository contains programs coded for the lab assignment (offline-2) on cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

SEED Ubuntu VM (v16.04, 32bit) provided by SEEDLabs was used as virtual lab environment. To demonstrate what attackers can do by exploiting XSS vulnerabilities, a web application named Elgg provided in the pre-built Ubuntu VM image was used. Basically, the vulnerabilities were exploited by launching an XSS attack on the modified version of Elgg.
